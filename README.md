# TravelByTrain
TravelByTrain is a web application built using React, TypeScript, SCSS, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and displaying train routes based on the user's preferred cities of departure and arrival.

## Features
* Home Page: The home page displays a header with the logo and a navigation bar. It also includes a form with two inputs where users can specify their desired cities of departure and arrival.

* Search Results: After submitting the form on the home page, users are navigated to the result page. Here, they can view the train routes available based on the specified cities. The train data is retrieved from the database and displayed in chronological order, starting from today and spanning the next seven days.

* Refresh Button: Users have the option to refresh the search results by clicking the refresh button. This action triggers the display of the form to update the cities of departure and arrival.

* Navigation: Users can easily return to the home page by clicking on the logo or the home link in the navigation bar.

* Add New Train: The application also provides an "Add New Train" page, where users can submit details of new train routes to be added to the database.
